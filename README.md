# Differential Reddening
Repository for the Research Project for the Stellar Astrophysics course.

The aim of this project is finding a way to correct the Color-Magnitude Diagram of two Globular Clusters affected by differential reddening. The final results can be seen in the following figures or in the images folder (black points are the original CMDs while colored points are the corrected one).
